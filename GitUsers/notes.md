## My notes

- Always try to not capitalize [email inputs](src/Login_Screen.js#L109)
- Ideally you'd want to have an activity indicator to show that somethung is loading
- Top marks for using firebase
- Ideally you'd want to have all your components start with [capital letters](App.js#L19) 
- Loved that you using themes here so cool
- And I like your attempt to arrange your file structure, but would have preferred you didn't use snake case to name your files but it's just a nitpick
- Love the code, neat, not a lot of hanging code
- All in all seems that you have a good understanding of react native, and if you do choose to continue with it you have great things ahead because you basically picked most of this up on your own with little supervision and in good time
